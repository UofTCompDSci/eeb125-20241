    "For this week's homework, we will look at the median percentage of coral coverage over all of the quadrats sampled in the `LTER` data. We will analyze data coming from six sites within a coral reef French Polinesia, from 2005 to 2022. Throughout these sites, with a quadrat sampling design along transects, percentage cover of corals, macroalgae, microalgae and sand were estimated across different depths and temperatures.\n",
