    "You will submit your work on [MarkUs](https://markus-ds.teach.cs.toronto.edu).\n",
    "To submit your work:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download this file (`Homework_4.ipynb`) from JupyterHub. (See [our JupyterHub Guide](../../../../guides/jupyterhub_guide.ipynb) for detailed instructions.)\n",
    "2. Submit this file to MarkUs under the **hw4** assignment. (See [our MarkUs Guide](../../../../guides/markus_guide.ipynb) for detailed instructions.)\n",

    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This week, you will be practicing a couple of programming techniques we examined in lecture to answer data science questions about sex-based differences in COVID infection and mortality across the United States. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using data from <https://www.genderscilab.org/gender-and-sex-in-covid19> for the week of 11/1/2021, which is available in `covid_sex.csv`. To inform your exploration, please read the article \"Whatâ€™s Really Behind the Gender Gap in Covid-19 Deaths?\", printed in the New York Times, available in `nytimes_covid_sex.pdf` (go to File -> Open... to open this PDF). We will be exploring this dataset to interpret whether 1) we can observe sex-based differences in the risk of death among those infected with COVID and 2) whether we can identify any sociopolitical, as opposed to biological, explanations for any observed differences."
